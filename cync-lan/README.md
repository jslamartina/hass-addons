# CyncLAN Bridge

**Local control for Cync/C by GE smart devices** - Control your lights, switches, and plugs via MQTT without cloud dependency.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DNS Redirection Required

You **must** configure DNS redirection to route these domains to your Home Assistant server:
- `cm-sec.gelighting.com`
- `cm.gelighting.com`
- `cm-ge.xlink.cn`

**[üìñ Complete DNS Setup Guide ‚Üí](https://github.com/jslamartina/hass-addons/blob/dev/docs/user/dns-setup.md)**

Without DNS redirection, your devices will continue using the cloud and this add-on won't work.

## What This Add-on Provides

- **Device Exporter** - Web UI to export your device list from Cync cloud (2FA supported)
- **nCync Server** - TCP server that masquerades as the Cync cloud controller
- **MQTT Bridge** - Automatic Home Assistant MQTT discovery integration

## Supported Devices

**Working:** Lights, plugs, switches
**Not Supported:** Battery-powered devices (motion sensors, wire-free devices)
**Untested:** Cameras, thermostats
