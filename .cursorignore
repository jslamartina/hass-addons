# .cursorignore - Override .gitignore for Cursor indexing
#
# This file allows Cursor to index files that are excluded from git.
# Use negation patterns (!) to include directories/files for indexing.
#
# Files included here will be:
# - Searchable via codebase_search and indexed lookups
# - Still excluded from git (via .gitignore)
# - Available for context in Cursor's AI features

# Include working files and code reviews in Cursor's index
!working-files/**
!code-reviews/**

# Still exclude certain file types even within included directories
*.db
*.db-journal
