"""
MQTT client package for Cync Controller.

Provides MQTT communication, device discovery, command processing, and state management.

This package refactors the monolithic mqtt_client.py into focused modules:
- client.py: Core MQTTClient class with connection lifecycle
- commands.py: Command pattern implementation
- discovery.py: Home Assistant device discovery
- command_routing.py: Message routing and handling
- state_updates.py: Device and group state publishing
