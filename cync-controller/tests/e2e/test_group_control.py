    Test Bug 4: Turning off a light group should turn off all member switches.

    Root cause: Group commands target bulbs via group ID, but switches (physical
    wall controllers) don't receive individual 0x83 status packets. The
    update_switch_from_subgroup() logic only runs when processing status packets.

    Fix: After sending a group command, the sync_group_switches() method proactively
    updates all member switches to match the group state via MQTT.

    Expected: After turning off "Hallway Lights" group, all member switches
    (4way Switch, Counter Switch, Front Switch) should show as OFF in Home Assistant.
