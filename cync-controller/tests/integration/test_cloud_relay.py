Cloud Relay Integration Tests

Tests cloud relay mode (MITM proxy) functionality:
- Relay mode setup
- Packet forwarding (device â†” cloud)
- LAN-only mode (no forwarding)
- Packet inspection and logging
- Packet injection

These tests require cloud relay mode to be enabled in docker-compose.test.yml.

# Note: Cloud relay tests are mostly placeholders because they require:
# 1. Cloud relay enabled in docker-compose environment
# 2. Mock cloud server or actual cloud connectivity
# 3. Packet capture and inspection tools
# 4. SSL/TLS certificate testing infrastructure
#
# These tests serve as:
# - Documentation of expected cloud relay behavior
# - Placeholder for future implementation
# - Markers for manual testing scenarios
#
# For now, cloud relay testing is done via:
# - scripts/test-cloud-relay.sh (automated configuration testing)
# - Manual testing with actual devices and cloud
# - Packet inspection via debug logging
