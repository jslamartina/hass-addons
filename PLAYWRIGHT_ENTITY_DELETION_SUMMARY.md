# Playwright Entity Deletion - Implementation Summary

## What Was Created

A comprehensive Playwright automation system for deleting MQTT entities while preserving the CyncLAN Bridge.

### Files Created

#### 1. Main Script
**`scripts/playwright/delete-all-mqtt-entities-except-bridge.ts`**
- TypeScript script using Playwright browser automation
- Discovers all MQTT entities via web UI
- Intelligently filters out bridge entities
- Deletes all non-bridge entities
- Cleans up device registry
- Dry run mode for preview
- Detailed logging and screenshots

#### 2. Shell Wrapper
**`scripts/delete-mqtt-entities-except-bridge.sh`**
- Convenient command-line interface
- Supports flags: `--dry-run`, `--restart`, `--headed`, `--bridge NAME`
- Loads credentials from `hass-credentials.env`
- User-friendly output formatting

#### 3. Documentation
- **`scripts/playwright/README.md`** - Complete technical documentation
- **`scripts/playwright/EXAMPLES.md`** - Real-world usage examples
- **`scripts/playwright/QUICKSTART.md`** - Quick reference guide
- **`DELETE_ENTITIES_GUIDE.md`** - User guide for developers

#### 4. npm Scripts
Updated `package.json` with convenience commands:
- `npm run playwright:delete-all-except-bridge`
- `npm run playwright:delete-all-except-bridge:dry-run`

## Quick Usage

### Simplest Form (Recommended)

```bash
# Preview what will be deleted
./scripts/delete-mqtt-entities-except-bridge.sh --dry-run

# Actually delete entities
./scripts/delete-mqtt-entities-except-bridge.sh

# Delete and restart addon
./scripts/delete-mqtt-entities-except-bridge.sh --restart
```

### npm Scripts

```bash
npm run playwright:delete-all-except-bridge:dry-run  # Preview
npm run playwright:delete-all-except-bridge           # Delete
```

## Key Features

### 🎯 Intelligent Discovery
- Automatically discovers all MQTT entities
- Classifies entities as "preserve" or "delete" based on bridge name
- Shows detailed summary before deletion

### 🛡️ Safety First
- **Dry run mode** - Preview before deletion
- **Bridge preservation** - Never deletes the bridge
- **Detailed logging** - Full audit trail
- **Screenshots** - Visual proof at each step
- **Error handling** - Continues on individual failures

### 🔧 Flexible Configuration
- Custom bridge name via `--bridge` flag
- Optional addon restart via `--restart` flag
- Headed mode for debugging via `--headed` flag
- Environment variable support for all settings

### 📊 Comprehensive Output

```
═════════════════ DISCOVERY SUMMARY ═════════════════
Total entities found: 24
✅ To preserve (CyncLAN Bridge): 1
   - CyncLAN Bridge
❌ To delete: 23
   - Hallway Front Switch
   - Hallway Counter Switch
   - Bedroom Ceiling Light
   ...
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Test Entity Rediscovery
```bash
./scripts/delete-mqtt-entities-except-bridge.sh --restart
```

### 2. Change suggested_area
```bash
# After editing mqtt_client.py
cd cync-lan && ./rebuild.sh
./scripts/delete-mqtt-entities-except-bridge.sh --restart
```

### 3. Clean Development Environment
```bash
./scripts/delete-mqtt-entities-except-bridge.sh --dry-run  # Preview
./scripts/delete-mqtt-entities-except-bridge.sh            # Delete
```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
1. **Browser Automation** - Playwright controls Chrome/Chromium
2. **Shadow DOM Handling** - Uses role-based selectors (pierce shadow boundaries)
3. **Reliable Clicking** - Fallback to programmatic dispatch for SVG issues
4. **Entity Discovery** - Iterates table rows, classifies by bridge name
5. **Batch Deletion** - Selects checkboxes, uses Action menu
6. **Registry Cleanup** - Removes device entries for fresh recreation

### Error Handling
- Continues on individual entity failures
- Logs all errors with context
- Never fails entire operation for single entity
- Provides screenshots for debugging

### Performance
- Headless mode (default): ~60-90 seconds for 20 entities
- Headed mode: Slightly slower but helps debugging
- Dry run: ~15-20 seconds (no actual deletion)

## Integration with Existing Tools

### Complements Other Scripts
- **`scripts/configure-addon.sh`** - Configure addon settings
- **`scripts/test-cloud-relay.sh`** - Test cloud relay functionality
- **`test-cync-lan.sh`** - Quick functional test
- **`scripts/playwright/delete-mqtt-entities.ts`** - Delete specific entities

### Workflow Example
```bash
# 1. Configure addon
./scripts/configure-addon.sh preset-baseline

# 2. Clean entities
./scripts/delete-mqtt-entities-except-bridge.sh --restart

# 3. Test
./test-cync-lan.sh

# 4. Verify
ha addons logs local_cync-lan
```

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
```bash
HA_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8123"  # Home Assistant URL
HA_USERNAME="dev"                     # Username
HA_PASSWORD="dev"                     # Password
ADDON_SLUG="local_cync-lan"          # Addon to restart
BRIDGE_NAME="CyncLAN Bridge"         # Bridge name to preserve
RESTART_ADDON="true"                  # Restart after deletion
DRY_RUN="true"                        # Preview mode
HEADED="1"                            # Show browser
```

### Command-Line Flags
```bash
--dry-run       # Preview without deleting
--restart       # Restart addon after deletion
--headed        # Show browser window (for debugging)
--bridge NAME   # Specify custom bridge name
--help          # Show help message
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No entities found
**Solution:** Run with `--headed` to see current page state
```bash
./scripts/delete-mqtt-entities-except-bridge.sh --headed
```

### Issue: Wrong entities selected
**Solution:** Verify bridge name matches exactly
```bash
./scripts/delete-mqtt-entities-except-bridge.sh --bridge "Exact Name" --dry-run
```

### Issue: Script fails
**Solution:** Check logs and screenshots
```bash
cat test-results/runs/delete-mqtt-*/run.log
ls -la test-results/runs/delete-mqtt-*/screenshots/
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Preview First
```bash
./scripts/delete-mqtt-entities-except-bridge.sh --dry-run
```

### 2. Use Headed Mode for Debugging
```bash
./scripts/delete-mqtt-entities-except-bridge.sh --headed
```

### 3. Check Logs After Execution
```bash
cat test-results/runs/delete-mqtt-*/run.log
```

### 4. Verify Bridge Preserved
After deletion, verify bridge still exists:
```bash
ha addons logs local_cync-lan | grep -i bridge
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Selective entity deletion by pattern (e.g., "Hallway.*")
- [ ] Multiple bridge preservation support
- [ ] Entity type filtering (only lights, only switches, etc.)
- [ ] JSON export of deleted entities
- [ ] Undo capability (restore from export)
- [ ] Integration with pytest for automated testing

✅ **Maintainability** - Well-documented, tested patterns

## Conclusion

This Playwright automation system provides a robust, safe, and efficient way to manage MQTT entities during CyncLAN Add-on development. It follows Home Assistant UI best practices, handles Shadow DOM complexity, and provides comprehensive logging for debugging.

**Ready to use:** All scripts are executable and documented.

**Next steps:** Try the dry run mode first!

```bash
./scripts/delete-mqtt-entities-except-bridge.sh --dry-run
```
