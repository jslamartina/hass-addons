Add the following inline comments to the respective files:

---

## 🔴 SEC-1: Hardcoded Credentials

### File: `cync-controller/config.yaml` (Line 39)

**Comment:**

````
🔴 **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE**: Hardcoded Personal Email Address

This configuration file contains a hardcoded personal email address that should not be committed to version control.

**Risk:** Personal information exposure, potential privacy violation

**Fix Required:**
- Remove this default value
- Set to `null` or provide placeholder
- Document credential setup in DOCS.md
- Rotate this credential immediately if it's been exposed

**Example Fix:**
```yaml
options:
  account_username: null  # User must configure via add-on UI
````

**Effort:** 15 minutes

```

### File: `cync-controller/config.yaml` (Lines 44-45)

**Comment:**
```

🔴 **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE**: Weak Default MQTT Credentials

Default credentials "dev"/"dev" are extremely weak and pose a security risk.

**Risk:**

- Unauthorized MQTT access
- Device control by attackers
- Data interception

**Fix Required:**

- Remove default credentials
- Force users to set strong passwords
- Add validation for password strength
- Document secure credential practices

**Example Fix:**

```yaml
mqtt_user: null # Required - no defaults
mqtt_pass: null # Required - must be strong password
```

**Effort:** 30 minutes

```

### File: `cync-controller/config.yaml.backup`

**Comment:**
```

🔴 **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE**: Sensitive Backup File Committed to Git

This backup file contains the same credentials as the main config and should NEVER be in version control.

**Risk:**

- Credential exposure in git history (permanent)
- Cannot be fully removed without rewriting history
- Violates security best practices

**Fix Required (IMMEDIATE):**

```bash
# Remove from repository
git rm cync-controller/config.yaml.backup

# Prevent future backups
echo "*.backup" >> .gitignore
echo "config.yaml.backup" >> .gitignore

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Remove sensitive backup file and update gitignore"
```

**NOTE:** This file will remain in git history. Consider it permanently exposed.

**Effort:** 15 minutes

```

---

### File: `cync-controller/Dockerfile` (Lines 38-39)

**Comment:**
```

🔴 **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE**: Hardcoded Credentials in Docker Image

Environment variables contain hardcoded email and empty password defaults.

**Risk:**

- Credentials baked into container images
- Pushed to container registries (public exposure risk)
- Difficult to rotate/update

**Fix Required:**

```dockerfile
# Remove hardcoded values
ENV CYNC_MQTT_USER="" \
 CYNC_MQTT_PASS="" \
 # ... other vars ...
```

These should be set at runtime via add-on configuration, NOT baked into the image.

**Effort:** 30 minutes

```

## 🔴 SEC-2: SSL/TLS Verification Disabled

### File: `mitm/query_mode.py` (Lines 13-14)

**Comment:**
```

🔴 **HIGH SECURITY ISSUE**: SSL Certificate Verification Disabled

This code disables SSL/TLS certificate verification, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Risk:**

- MITM attacks possible
- No protection against certificate tampering
- Insecure by design

**This is acceptable ONLY for local debugging.**

**Fix Required:**

1. Add prominent warning at top of file:

```python
"""
⚠️  SECURITY WARNING: DEBUG TOOL ONLY
This script disables SSL verification for MITM debugging.
DO NOT USE in production or with untrusted networks.
"""
```

2. Consider moving all MITM tools to separate repository:
   - `baudneo/cync-debugging-tools`
   - Clearly separate from production code
   - Reduce security risk surface

**Effort:** 2 hours (including repo restructure)

```

---

### File: `mitm/send_via_mitm.py` (Lines 99-100)

**Comment:**
```

🔴 **HIGH SECURITY ISSUE**: SSL Verification Disabled

Same issue as other MITM tools - SSL verification is disabled.

**Fix Required:**

- Add security warnings
- Document debugging-only purpose
- Consider separate repository for debug tools

See comment on `mitm/query_mode.py` for full details.

**Effort:** 30 minutes

```

---

### File: `mitm/mitm_with_injection.py` (Lines 493-494, 506-507)

**Comment:**
```

🔴 **HIGH SECURITY ISSUE**: Multiple SSL Verification Bypasses

This MITM proxy disables SSL verification in multiple places:

- Line 493-494: Server context
- Line 506-507: Client context

**This is extremely dangerous if used outside of controlled debugging.**

**Fix Required:**

1. Add file-level warning:

```python
"""
⚠️⚠️⚠️ SECURITY WARNING ⚠️⚠️⚠️
This is a Man-in-the-Middle proxy for debugging Cync protocol.
- Disables ALL SSL security
- For LOCAL DEBUGGING ONLY
- DO NOT use on untrusted networks
- DO NOT use in production
⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
"""
```

2. Move to separate debug repository
3. Add README warning in MITM directory

**Effort:** 1 hour

```

## 🔴 SEC-3: Additional Security Concerns

### File: `mitm/mitm_with_injection.py` (Lines 72-75)

**Comment:**
```

🟡 **MEDIUM SECURITY ISSUE**: Silent Exception Handling

Bare `except` clause silently swallows all errors, including security-relevant ones.

**Risk:**

- Security errors hidden
- Attack attempts undetected
- Difficult debugging

**Fix Required:**

```python
# Replace
try:
    with open("mitm.log", "a") as f:
        f.write(log_msg + "\n")
except Exception:
    pass  # ❌ Silent failure

# With
try:
    with open("mitm.log", "a") as f:
        f.write(log_msg + "\n")
except IOError as e:
    print(f"WARNING: Log write failed: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"ERROR: Unexpected logging error: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
```

**Effort:** 1 hour (across all files)

```

### File: `cync-controller/static/index.html` (Line 142)

**Comment:**
```

🟡 **MEDIUM ISSUE**: Deprecated Clipboard API

`document.execCommand('copy')` is deprecated and may not work in all browsers.

**Fix Required:**

```javascript
// Replace deprecated API
async function copyConfig() {
  const yamlText = document
    .querySelector("#yamlPreview code")
    .textContent.trim();

  try {
    // Modern Clipboard API
    await navigator.clipboard.writeText(yamlText);
    showToast("Config copied to clipboard!");
  } catch (e) {
    showError("Failed to copy: " + e.message);
  }
}
```

**Effort:** 30 minutes
**Browser Support:** Check for fallback on older browsers

```
