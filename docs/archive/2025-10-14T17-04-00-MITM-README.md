# Archived MITM Tools

This directory contains historical documentation for the Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) debugging tools that were used during the initial protocol analysis phase of the CyncLAN project.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE

**These tools are ARCHIVED and should NOT be used in production environments.**

The MITM tools have been replaced by the **Cloud Relay Mode** functionality in the main CyncLAN add-on, which provides the same debugging capabilities without the security risks.

## What Was Here

### Documentation (Archived)
- `README.md` - Original security warnings and usage guide
- `MITM_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - How to use the MITM proxy
- `FINDINGS_SUMMARY.md` - Complete protocol analysis results
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Protocol cleanup and optimization notes
- `mode_change_analysis.md` - Packet capture examples and mode change analysis

### Code (Removed)
All MITM code has been deleted, including:
- `mitm_with_injection.py` - Main MITM proxy with packet injection
- `query_mode.py` - Device mode query tool
- `send_via_mitm.py` - Mode change packet sender
- `packet_parser.py` - Protocol packet parser
- Various shell scripts for MITM setup and testing

## Why Archived

The MITM tools were designed for:
- Local debugging of Cync device communication
- Protocol analysis and reverse engineering
- Development and testing in controlled environments

However, they had **critical security risks**:
- Disabled ALL SSL/TLS certificate verification
- Made users vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks
- Should never be used on untrusted networks

## Modern Replacement

Use **Cloud Relay Mode** in the main CyncLAN add-on instead:

```bash
# Enable cloud relay mode via API
./scripts/configure-addon.sh preset-relay-debug

# Or manually configure in add-on settings:
# cloud_relay:
#   enabled: true
#   debug_packet_logging: true
```

**Benefits of Cloud Relay Mode:**
- ✅ Same debugging capabilities
- ✅ No security risks (proper SSL/TLS)
- ✅ Integrated with main add-on
- ✅ Production-ready
- ✅ Automatic DNS redirection handling

## Historical Reference

These files are kept for historical reference only. The protocol analysis work done with MITM tools was foundational to understanding the Cync protocol and developing the current cloud relay functionality.

## Security Warning (Preserved)

**NEVER use archived MITM tools in production.** They are permanently compromised for security purposes and should only be studied for historical understanding of the protocol analysis process.
