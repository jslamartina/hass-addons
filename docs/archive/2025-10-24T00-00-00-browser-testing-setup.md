- Home Assistant specifics (credentials, quirks)
- When to use MCP vs TypeScript scripts
- Debugging pattern
- Common scenarios

### 3. **MCP Tools Guide Update** 📚
**Location:** `docs/developer/mcp-tools.md`

**Changes:**
- Added `cursor-playwright` to quick reference table
- Added comprehensive Browser Automation section with:
  - All 17 available tools
  - When to use vs when NOT to use
  - Example use cases
  - Features and gotchas
  - Links to detailed documentation

### 4. **AGENTS.md Update** 🤖
**Location:** `AGENTS.md`

**Changes:**
- Added browser automation to MCP Development Tools section
- Highlighted as NEW feature
- Added direct link to AI Browser Testing Plan
- Updated quick reference to include browser automation

## How to Use

### For AI Agents (Like Me!)

1. **Start with the quick reference:**
   - Read `.cursor/rules/ai-browser-testing.mdc` for fast patterns

2. **For comprehensive guidance:**
   - Consult `docs/developer/ai-browser-testing-plan.md`

3. **For tool details:**
   - Check `docs/developer/mcp-tools.md` Browser Automation section

### Common Workflows

#### Quick UI Verification
```typescript
// 1. Take snapshot to understand structure
mcp_cursor-playwright_browser_snapshot()

// 2. Take screenshot for visual verification
mcp_cursor-playwright_browser_take_screenshot({ filename: "state.png" })

// 3. Check console for errors
mcp_cursor-playwright_browser_console_messages()
```

#### Test Add-on Configuration
```typescript
// 1. Navigate and login
// 2. Go to add-on config (remember: iframe!)
// 3. Use snapshot to find options
// 4. Verify changes with screenshots
```

#### Debug UI Issue
```typescript
// 1. Navigate to problem page
// 2. Screenshot before action
// 3. Perform action
// 4. Screenshot after action
// 5. Check console and network
```

## Key Features

✅ **No Setup Required** - Cursor's MCP Playwright tools work out-of-the-box

✅ **Comprehensive Guides** - Every tool, pattern, and quirk documented

✅ **Home Assistant Specifics** - Shadow DOM, iframes, and HA UI patterns covered

✅ **Best Practices** - Learned from existing TypeScript scripts

✅ **Integration Ready** - Works alongside existing Playwright automation

✅ **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions documented

✅ **Templates** - Reusable patterns for common scenarios

## What This Enables

### Before (TypeScript Scripts Only)
- ❌ Manual UI exploration required
- ❌ Hard to verify visual issues
- ❌ Complex scripts for simple checks
- ❌ Long feedback loops

### After (MCP Browser Tools)
- ✅ AI agents can explore UI autonomously
- ✅ Visual verification with screenshots
- ✅ Quick ad-hoc testing
- ✅ Immediate feedback on UI state
- ✅ Better debugging capabilities
- ✅ Integration with existing scripts

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Verify Configuration Option Appears
**Before:** Rebuild, restart, manually check UI
**After:** Agent navigates, takes snapshot, verifies option present

### 2. Debug Entity Not Showing
**Before:** Check logs, manual UI inspection
**After:** Agent checks Developer Tools → States, searches entity, reports findings

### 3. Test Device Control
**Before:** Manual interaction, watch logs
**After:** Agent clicks card, adjusts slider, verifies state, checks logs

### 4. Validate Error Handling
**Before:** Manual error triggering, observe behavior
**After:** Agent triggers error, screenshots state, checks console

## Integration with Existing Tools

### MCP Browser Tools
**Best for:**
- Interactive exploration
- Quick verification
- Ad-hoc testing
- Debugging

### TypeScript Scripts (`scripts/playwright/`)
**Best for:**
- Automated workflows
- Bulk operations
- CI/CD integration
- Complex scenarios

### API Tools (`scripts/configure-addon.sh`)
**Best for:**
- Configuration changes
- Add-on management
- Programmatic operations

**All three complement each other!**

## Next Steps

### For AI Agents
1. Try the quick start pattern in the rule file
2. Explore a Home Assistant page with `browser_snapshot()`
3. Practice with common scenarios
4. Document any new patterns discovered

### For Humans
1. Review the documentation structure
2. Try examples with `--headed` mode to see browser
3. Extend with project-specific patterns
4. Share findings with the team
