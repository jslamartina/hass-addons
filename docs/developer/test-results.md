**Status:** PASS
**Purpose:** Test secure vs debug SSL modes

**Validated:**

1. **Secure Mode (default):**
   - SSL connections established
   - NO security warnings
   - Production-ready

2. **Debug Mode Implementation:**
   - Code review confirmed warnings exist:
     ```python
     # Line 63:
     "SSL verification DISABLED - DEBUG MODE (use only for local testing)"

     # Lines 90-92:
     "‚ö†Ô∏è  SSL VERIFICATION DISABLED - DEBUG MODE ACTIVE ‚ö†Ô∏è"
     ```

**Conclusion:** Both modes implemented correctly with prominent warnings for insecure mode.

### ‚úÖ Phase 7: Edge Cases & Error Handling
**Status:** PASS
**Purpose:** Test stability and error conditions

**Validated:**

1. **Error Handling:**
   - 13 errors total across all testing
   - All errors graceful (shutdown-related "Event loop closed")
   - No operational errors
   - No crashes

2. **Multiple Devices:**
   - 4 devices connected simultaneously
   - Each with independent relay connection
   - Packet logs clearly identify devices

3. **Mode Switching:**
   - 6 configuration changes tested
   - All transitions successful
   - Devices reconnect properly

4. **Stability:**
   - 30+ minutes of testing
