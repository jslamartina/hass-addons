# AI Agent Guidance

This repository uses Cursor Rules for all development guidance.

## Quick Navigation

- **[Rules Guide](.cursor/RULES_GUIDE.md)** - Complete rule index and organization
- **[All Rules](.cursor/rules/)** - Browse individual rule files

## What Changed?

The old `AGENTS.md` file has been replaced with modular Cursor Rules (`.mdc` files) to provide:
- Better organization and discoverability
- Context-aware guidance (rules apply based on file type)
- Reduced duplication and clearer focus
- Improved maintainability

## Getting Started

1. Start with **[quick-start.mdc](.cursor/rules/quick-start.mdc)** for an overview
2. Follow **[development-workflow.mdc](.cursor/rules/development-workflow.mdc)** for the 4-step process
3. Reference specific rules as needed during development

## Key Rules

- **[development-workflow.mdc](.cursor/rules/development-workflow.mdc)** - How to make changes
- **[linting-mandatory.mdc](.cursor/rules/linting-mandatory.mdc)** - Code quality
- **[git-practices.mdc](.cursor/rules/git-practices.mdc)** - Git workflow
- **[critical-commands.mdc](.cursor/rules/critical-commands.mdc)** - Command handling
- **[critical-credentials.mdc](.cursor/rules/critical-credentials.mdc)** - Security
