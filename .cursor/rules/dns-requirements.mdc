# DNS Requirements

**CRITICAL:** The Cync Controller add-on **REQUIRES** DNS redirection to function. Without it, devices will continue using the cloud.

## Required Domain Redirects

**Newer Firmware:**
```
cm.gelighting.com → Your Home Assistant IP
cm-sec.gelighting.com → Your Home Assistant IP
```

**Older Firmware:**
```
cm-ge.xlink.cn → Your Home Assistant IP
```

**Check which domains your devices use:**
```bash
grep "xlink.cn" /var/log/dns.log
grep "gelighting.com" /var/log/dns.log
```

## OPNsense with Unbound (Selective Routing)

**Configuration:**
```
server:
access-control-view: 10.0.2.216/32 cync-override-hass
access-control-view: 10.0.2.223/32 cync-override-hass

view:
name: "cync-override-hass"
local-zone: "homelab" static
local-data: "cm.gelighting.com. 90 IN A 10.0.1.20"
local-data: "cm-sec.gelighting.com. 90 IN A 10.0.1.20"
local-data: "cm-ge.xlink.cn. 90 IN A 10.0.1.20"
```

**Setup:**
1. Go to Services → Unbound DNS → Custom Options
2. Paste configuration (adjust IPs)
3. Restart Unbound
3. Power cycle Cync devices

**Note:** Trailing `.` after domain in `local-data:` required. No leading `.` in `local-zone:`.

## Pi-hole (Network-Wide)

**Setup:**
1. Navigate to Local DNS → DNS Records
2. Add DNS record for each domain
3. Click Add
4. Power cycle Cync devices

**Limitation:** Network-wide only (affects all devices, cannot add new devices without disabling).

## Selective vs Network-Wide

**Selective (OPNsense/Unbound):**
- ✅ Only affects specific Cync devices
- ✅ Can still add new devices via app
- ⚠️ More complex setup

**Network-Wide (Pi-hole, DNSCryptProxy):**
- ✅ Simple setup
- ❌ Cannot add new devices without disabling redirect
- ❌ Phone app affected if on same network

## Testing

```bash
# Test DNS redirect (should return HA IP)
dig cm.gelighting.com

# Check connection attempts
ha addons logs local_cync-controller --follow
# Should see: "New device connected from <device-ip>"
```

## Common Issues

**Devices Not Connecting:**
- Verify DNS redirect: `dig cm.gelighting.com`
- Ensure devices power cycled (unplug 10+ seconds)
- Check firewall allows TCP 23779

**Cannot Add New Devices:**
- Temporarily disable DNS overrides
- Add device using Cync app
- Re-enable DNS overrides
- Export new config from add-on, restart, power cycle device

**Mix of New and Old Firmware:**
- Redirect all three domains: cm.gelighting.com, cm-sec.gelighting.com, cm-ge.xlink.cn

## Best Practices

**Prefer These Devices for Local Connection:**
1. LED strip controllers ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
2. Always-on bulbs ⭐⭐⭐⭐
3. Plugs ⭐⭐⭐

**Target 4-6 always-on devices** for optimal performance.

**Do NOT redirect your phone** - Keep phone using cloud for device management and adding new devices.
