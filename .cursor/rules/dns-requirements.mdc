# DNS Requirements

**CRITICAL:** The Cync Controller add-on **REQUIRES** DNS redirection to function. Without it, devices will continue using the cloud.

## Required Domain Redirects

### Newer Firmware

```text
cm.gelighting.com → Your Home Assistant IP
cm-sec.gelighting.com → Your Home Assistant IP
```

### Older Firmware

```text
cm-ge.xlink.cn → Your Home Assistant IP
```

### Check which domains your devices use

```bash
grep "xlink.cn" /var/log/dns.log
grep "gelighting.com" /var/log/dns.log
```

## OPNsense with Unbound (Selective Routing)

### Configuration

```yaml

server:
access-control-view: 10.0.2.216/32 cync-override-hass
access-control-view: 10.0.2.223/32 cync-override-hass

view:
name: "cync-override-hass"
local-zone: "homelab" static
local-data: "cm.gelighting.com. 90 IN A 10.0.1.20"
local-data: "cm-sec.gelighting.com. 90 IN A 10.0.1.20"
local-data: "cm-ge.xlink.cn. 90 IN A 10.0.1.20"

```

### Setup

1. Go to Services → Unbound DNS → Custom Options
2. Paste configuration (adjust IPs)
3. Restart Unbound
4. Power cycle Cync devices

**Note:** Trailing `.` after domain in `local-data:` required. No leading `.` in `local-zone:`.

## Pi-hole (Network-Wide)

### Setup

1. Navigate to Local DNS → DNS Records
2. Add DNS record for each domain
3. Click Add
4. Power cycle Cync devices

**Limitation:** Network-wide only (affects all devices, can't add new devices without disabling).

## Selective vs Network-Wide

### Selective (OPNsense/Unbound with Views)

- ✅ Only affects specific Cync devices (by IP)
- ✅ Can still add new devices via app
- ✅ Phone not affected (can manage devices)
- ⚠️ More complex setup (requires view configuration)
- **Recommended** for production use

### Network-Wide (Pi-hole, DNSCryptProxy, Unbound without Views)

- ✅ Simple setup (single redirect rule)
- ❌ Can't add new devices without disabling redirect
- ❌ Phone app affected if on same network
- ❌ Must disable temporarily to add new devices
- **Use only** for testing or isolated networks

**Safety:** Keep phones on cloud DNS (don't redirect their traffic) to allow device management.

## Testing and Verification

```bash
## Test DNS redirect (should return HA IP)
dig +short cm.gelighting.com
## Expected: 10.0.1.20 (your HA IP)

## Check TTL (Time To Live)
dig cm.gelighting.com | grep "^cm.gelighting.com"
## Should show TTL (e.g., 90 seconds)

## Flush DNS cache on device (if needed)
## iOS: Airplane mode on/off
## Android: Clear DNS cache in settings
## Windows: ipconfig /flushdns
## Linux: sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches

## Verify from device's perspective
nslookup cm.gelighting.com

## Check connection attempts
ha addons logs local_cync-controller --follow
## Should see: "New device connected from <device-ip>"
```

## Common Issues

### Devices Not Connecting

- Verify DNS redirect: `dig cm.gelighting.com`
- Ensure devices power cycled (unplug 10+ seconds)
- Check firewall allows TCP 23779

### Can't Add New Devices

- Temporarily disable DNS overrides
- Add device using Cync app
- Re-enable DNS overrides
- Export new config from add-on, restart, power cycle device

### Mix of New and Old Firmware

- Redirect all three domains: cm.gelighting.com, cm-sec.gelighting.com, cm-ge.xlink.cn

## Best Practices

### Prefer These Devices for Local Connection

1. LED strip controllers ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
2. Always-on bulbs ⭐⭐⭐⭐
3. Plugs ⭐⭐⭐

**Target 4-6 always-on devices** for optimal performance.

**DON'T redirect your phone** - Keep phone using cloud for device management and adding new devices.
