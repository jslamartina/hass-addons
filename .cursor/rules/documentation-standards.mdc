# Documentation Standards

## See Executive Rule 8 (Concise Communication) and Rule 9 (Completion Approval) in `_00-rules-prefix.mdc`

## Living Documents

1. Documents under a /living folder represent the _current_ status of the architecture.
2. They should NEVER contain:
   - Status updates (for example, "planned," "complete," "in progress")
   - Timelines, histories, or dates
   - References to project milestones or Phases
   - TODO markers or incomplete placeholders
   - Any project management context
3. These documents are to be completely independent and decoupled from project management.
4. Documents the HOW & WHAT of the application _right now_.
   1. NOT WHY it's the way it is.
   2. NOT how it _USED TO BE_
   3. NOT how it _WILL BE_

**Note**: Spec files (outside `/living/`) MAY contain TODOs, status indicators, timelines, and phase references. Only `/living/` docs have these restrictions.

## User Approval Workflow

1. Complete investigation/test
2. Share BRIEF summary with user (< 10 lines)
3. Wait for user feedback/approval
4. ONLY THEN update documentation

## Document Length Limits

- Max 1 findings file per investigation
- NO separate completion/summary/README wrappers

## Investigation Template

```markdown
## Investigation: [Question]

## Answer

[2-3 sentences max]

## Evidence

- Key findings only

## Implications

- What this means (NO repetition)

## Files

- Supporting artifacts
```

## Quick Checks

Before creating docs:

1. Can I answer in < 100 lines?
2. Am I creating redundant files?
3. Am I repeating myself?

If yes to 2 or 3 → STOP and consolidate.
