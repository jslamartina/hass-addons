# Documentation Standards

## See Executive Rule 8 (Concise Communication) and Rule 9 (Completion Approval) in `_00-rules-prefix.mdc`

## Living Documents

1. Documents under a /living folder represent the *current* status of the architecture.
2. They should NEVER contain status updates, timelines, histories, references to any project milestones or Phases, etc.
3. These documents are to be completely independent and decoupled from project management.
4. Documents the HOW & WHAT of the application *right now*.
   1. NOT WHY it is the way it is.
   2. NOT how it *USED TO BE*
   3. NOT how it *WILL BE*

## User Approval Workflow

1. Complete investigation/test
2. Share BRIEF summary with user (< 10 lines)
3. Wait for user feedback/approval
4. ONLY THEN update documentation

## Document Length Limits

- Max 1 findings file per investigation
- NO separate completion/summary/README wrappers

## Investigation Template

```markdown
## Investigation: [Question]

## Answer

[2-3 sentences max]

## Evidence

- Key findings only

## Implications

- What this means (NO repetition)

## Files

- Supporting artifacts
```

## Quick Checks

Before creating docs:

1. Can I answer in < 100 lines?
2. Am I creating redundant files?
3. Am I repeating myself?

If yes to 2 or 3 → STOP and consolidate.
