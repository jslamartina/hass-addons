# Documentation Standards

## See Executive Rule 8 (Concise Communication) and Rule 9 (Completion Approval) in `_00-rules-prefix.mdc`

## User Approval Workflow

1. Complete investigation/test
2. Share BRIEF summary with user (< 10 lines)
3. Wait for user feedback/approval
4. ONLY THEN update documentation

## Document Length Limits

- Max 1 findings file per investigation
- NO separate completion/summary/README wrappers

## Investigation Template

```markdown
## Investigation: [Question]

## Answer

[2-3 sentences max]

## Evidence

- Key findings only

## Implications

- What this means (NO repetition)

## Files

- Supporting artifacts
```

## Quick Checks

Before creating docs:

1. Can I answer in < 100 lines?
2. Am I creating redundant files?
3. Am I repeating myself?

If yes to 2 or 3 → STOP and consolidate.
