# Web Search - Use Brave Search MCP

## Critical: Built-in web_search is Broken

**DON'T use the built-in `web_search` tool** - it doesn't work properly in this environment.

**ALWAYS use Brave Search MCP tools instead** for any web searches.

## Available Brave Search Tools

### General Web Search (Primary Tool)

```bash
mcp_brave-search_brave_web_search
```

Use for: Most web searches, research, current information, documentation lookup

Example:

```python
query="Python asyncio best practices"
count=10  # Number of results (default: 10, max: 20)
```

### Specialized Search Tools

**News Search** - Recent news and articles:

```bash
mcp_brave-search_brave_news_search
```

**Video Search** - Find video content:

```bash
mcp_brave-search_brave_video_search
```

**Image Search** - Find images and visual content:

```bash
mcp_brave-search_brave_image_search
```

**Local Search** (Pro plan only) - Businesses, restaurants, locations:

```bash
mcp_brave-search_brave_local_search
```

## When to Search

Per user memory [[memory:9966253]]: **Automatically search** whenever you don't know something. Don't ask for permission.

Examples:

- Information beyond training data cutoff
- Current package versions or API changes
- Documentation for unfamiliar libraries
- Recent news or events
- Technical specifications

## Search Strategy

1. **Start broad** - Use `brave_web_search` for general queries
2. **Specialize** - Use news/video/image search for specific content types
3. **Multiple queries** - Break complex questions into smaller searches
4. **Cite sources** - Always include URLs in responses

## Setup

The Brave Search MCP server is configured in `.cursor/mcp.json` and uses `BRAVE_SEARCH_FREE_API_KEY` from `hass-credentials.env`.

Startup script: `scripts/start-brave-search-mcp.sh`
