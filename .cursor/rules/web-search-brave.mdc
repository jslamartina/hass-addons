# Web Search - Use Brave Search MCP

## Critical: Use this when the built-in web_search does not appear to be working properly. This is a **backup** tool

## Available Brave Search Tools

### General Web Search (Primary Tool)

```bash
mcp_brave-search_brave_web_search
```

Use for: Most web searches, research, current information, documentation lookup

Example:

```python
query="Python asyncio best practices"
count=10  # Number of results (default: 10, max: 20)
```

### Specialized Search Tools

**News Search** - Recent news and articles:

```bash
mcp_brave-search_brave_news_search
```

**Video Search** - Find video content:

```bash
mcp_brave-search_brave_video_search
```

**Image Search** - Find images and visual content:

```bash
mcp_brave-search_brave_image_search
```

**Local Search** (Pro plan only) - Businesses, restaurants, locations:

```bash
mcp_brave-search_brave_local_search
```

## When to Search

Per user memory [[memory:9966253]]: **Automatically search** whenever you don't know something. Don't ask for permission.

Examples:

- Information beyond training data cutoff
- Current package versions or API changes
- Documentation for unfamiliar libraries
- Recent news or events
- Technical specifications

## Search Strategy

1. **Start broad** - Use `brave_web_search` for general queries
2. **Specialize** - Use news/video/image search for specific content types
3. **Multiple queries** - Break complex questions into smaller searches
4. **Cite sources** - Always include URLs in responses

## Fetching Specific URLs

- Prefer MCP tools (Brave Search, Brave AI Grounding CLI) whenever they already expose the needed information—they only return text, so they keep context lean.
- When you must fetch a specific URL by hand, NEVER fetch raw HTML. Strip styling/JS by piping `curl` output through `lynx` (installed in the devcontainer) and pipe out only the relevant lines:

```bash
curl -sS "https://example.com/page" | lynx -dump -stdin
```

- Keep the excerpt concise (quote only the portion needed to answer the question) and still provide the source URL in your response.
- If `lynx` ever becomes unavailable, fall back to another text-only converter (for example, a tiny `python3 html.parser` filter) after alerting the user.

## Setup

The Brave Search MCP server is configured in `.cursor/mcp.json` and uses `BRAVE_SEARCH_FREE_API_KEY` from `hass-credentials.env`.

Startup script: `scripts/start-brave-search-mcp.sh`
