# Linting Is Mandatory

Run linters after every edit and fix all issues **before** suggesting commits.

```bash
npm run lint:python:fix && npm run format:python  # Python auto-fix/format
npm run format                                   # Global formatting
npm run lint                                     # Final check (Python, Shell, Format)
```

- Do not skip linting for "small" changes or bypass failures with `--force`.
- Restart/rebuild only after lint succeeds.
- Reference `CONTRIBUTING.md` if unclear on standards.
