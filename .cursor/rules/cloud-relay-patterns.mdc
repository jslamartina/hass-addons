# Cloud Relay Mode Patterns

## ⚠️ Cloud relay mode is READ-ONLY for monitoring and inspection

**Commands from Home Assistant DON'T work in relay mode** - you'll see `No TCP bridges available!` errors.

**Rule:** Disable relay mode for normal local control.

## When to Enable

✅ **Protocol analysis** - Reverse engineering packet structures
✅ **Debugging device behavior** - Observing cloud communication
✅ **Packet inspection** - Monitor traffic with forwarding to cloud
✅ **Privacy monitoring** - Block cloud access, log attempts

❌ **Normal local control** - Commands don't work!
❌ **Production use** - Read-only limitation
❌ **Daily usage** - Use baseline mode instead

## Configuration Presets

```bash
## Baseline (LAN-only, normal operation)
./scripts/configure-addon.sh preset-baseline

## Relay with cloud forwarding (packet inspection)
./scripts/configure-addon.sh preset-relay-with-forward

## Relay with debug logging (protocol analysis)
./scripts/configure-addon.sh preset-relay-debug

## LAN-only relay (privacy mode, blocks cloud)
./scripts/configure-addon.sh preset-lan-only
```

## Configuration Options

```yaml
cloud_relay:
  enabled: false                # Enable relay mode
  forward_to_cloud: true        # Forward packets to cloud
  cloud_server: "35.196.85.236" # Cync cloud IP
  cloud_port: 23779             # Cync cloud port
  debug_packet_logging: false   # Verbose packet logging
  # disable_ssl_verification: true  # INSECURE - see warning below
```

**Security Warning:** Never use `disable_ssl_verification: true` in production.

## Switching Modes

```bash
## Enable relay for debugging
./scripts/configure-addon.sh preset-relay-debug

## Monitor logs
ha addons logs local_cync-controller --follow | grep "packet"

## Return to normal mode
./scripts/configure-addon.sh preset-baseline
```

## Operating Modes

### Mode 1: Baseline (Recommended)

- ✅ Full local control
- ✅ Commands work from Home Assistant
- ❌ No packet inspection

### Mode 2: Relay with Cloud Forwarding

- ✅ Devices still work (cloud receives packets)
- ✅ Basic packet logging
- ❌ Commands from HA don't work

### Mode 3: LAN-Only with Inspection

- ✅ Blocks all cloud communication
- ✅ Logs what devices attempt to send
- ❌ Devices lose cloud functionality

## Known Issues

### Commands Don't Work

- Symptom: Turning on lights in HA has no effect
- Cause: Relay mode is read-only
- Fix: Disable relay mode for normal operation

### Devices Show Offline

- Cause: Relay doesn't maintain bidirectional TCP connections properly
- Fix: Use relay temporarily, return to baseline for daily use
