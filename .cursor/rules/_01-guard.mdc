# Guard: ACK Required Before Action

**CRITICAL:** On your first reply in any new thread/phase, acknowledge rules before taking any action.

## Required ACK Format

**Start your first reply with exactly:**

```
ACK:{
  rules_you_will_follow: [list 7 executive rules from _00-exec-rules.mdc],
  how_you_will_verify: [3 bullets max - how you'll verify you followed each rule]
}
```

**End your first reply with:**

```
ACK-DONE
```

## If You Cannot Comply

Output only:
```
ACK-FAIL: <brief reason>
```

## GUARD Rule

**NEVER call tools or take actions until:**
1. You've emitted the complete `ACK:{...}` block
2. You've ended with `ACK-DONE`

**If ACK block is missing:** Emit ACK first. No tool calls until `ACK-DONE` is emitted.

## NEVER

- ❌ Call tools before emitting ACK
- ❌ Skip the ACK block
- ❌ Emit partial or incomplete ACK
- ❌ Take actions without `ACK-DONE`
