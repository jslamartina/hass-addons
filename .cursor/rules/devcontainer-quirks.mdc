# Devcontainer Essentials

- Read `.devcontainer/README.md` first; supervisor + Docker already managed.
- Never start Docker manuallyâ€”`supervisor_run` handles lifecycle.
- Backup restore in `post-start.sh` is disabled by default; only re-enable after testing.
- Scripts needing Supervisor API must run via `ha` CLI or `docker exec hassio_cli ...`; `supervisor` hostname is not reachable from the devcontainer shell.
- Credentials: Home Assistant at `http://localhost:8123` (`dev` / `dev`, see `hass-credentials.env`).
- Common commands:
  ```bash
  ha addons logs local_cync-controller --follow
  ha addons restart local_cync-controller
  ha addons rebuild local_cync-controller   # after Python edits
  npm run lint
  ```
