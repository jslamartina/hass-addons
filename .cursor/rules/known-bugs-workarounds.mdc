# Known Bugs and Workarounds

## Pattern Recognition: Common Issues

### Commands Don't Work / Lights Don't Turn On
**Root Cause:** Missing `ControlMessageCallback` registration before sending command
**Fix:** Always register callback in `bridge_device.messages.control[msg_id]` before calling `bridge_device.write()`

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Register callback BEFORE sending
m_cb = ControlMessageCallback(
    msg_id=cmsg_id,
    message=payload_bytes,
    sent_at=time.time(),
    callback=your_callback_coroutine,
    device_id=device.id,
)
bridge_device.messages.control[cmsg_id] = m_cb
await bridge_device.write(payload_bytes)
```

### Commands Work Once, Then Fail / Need to Click Twice
**Root Cause:** Auto-refresh after ACK caused cascading refreshes
**Fix:** Removed automatic refresh from ACK handler (fixed in Oct 14, 2025)
**Pattern to avoid:** Never auto-refresh after ACKs

### Devices Flicker Between Available/Unavailable
**Root Cause:** Unreliable `connected_to_mesh` byte causing immediate offline marking
**Fix:** Use `offline_count` threshold - devices only marked offline after 3 consecutive failures

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Use offline count threshold
if consecutive_failures >= OFFLINE_THRESHOLD:
    mark_device_offline(device_id)
else:
    increment_offline_count(device_id)
```

### Group Commands: Switches Don't Update When Group Turns Off
**Root Cause:** Group commands don't trigger individual 0x83 status packets from switches
**Fix:** Call `sync_group_switches()` immediately after sending group command

### OTP Submission Fails First Time
**Root Cause:** Token written to file before `self.token_cache` set in memory
**Fix:** Set `self.token_cache` in memory FIRST, then attempt file write

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

```python
# ❌ DON'T: Auto-refresh after ACKs (creates refresh storms)
async def handle_ack():
    update_state()
    await trigger_status_refresh()  # BAD!

# ❌ DON'T: Immediate offline marking (causes flickering)
if ping_fails:
    device.online = False  # BAD!

# ❌ DON'T: Missing callback registration (silent failure)
await bridge_device.write(payload_bytes)  # BAD! No callback registered
```

## Debugging Tips

- **"Callback NOT found"** - Add callback registration before `bridge_device.write()`
- **Rapid refresh sequences** - Remove automatic refresh calls after ACKs
- **Devices rapidly toggling offline/online** - Implement offline count threshold
- **Token not found in cache** - Set token in memory before file operations
