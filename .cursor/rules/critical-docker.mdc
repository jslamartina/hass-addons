# Critical Docker & Devcontainer Rules

## Rule: Don't Start Docker Manually

**Do not start Docker manually in devcontainer scripts** - supervisor already does it.

- Docker is managed by `supervisor_run`
- Manual Docker start causes conflicts
- Read `.devcontainer/README.md` for quirks

## Rule: Python Edits Require Rebuild

**Python edits: restart â‰  rebuild.**

- Python files are baked into Docker image at build time
- Always run `cd cync-controller && ./rebuild.sh` after Python changes
- Restarting alone will not load Python changes

## Rule: Backup Restore Logic

**Don't change backup restore logic without testing per `.devcontainer/README.md`.**

- Backup restore in `post-start.sh` is disabled by default
- Only re-enable after thorough testing
- Commented lines: see `.devcontainer/post-start.sh` lines 131-216
