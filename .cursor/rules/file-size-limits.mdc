# CRITICAL: File Size Limits

**Code files must NEVER exceed 600 lines unless strictly necessary.**

## Rule

Keep files under 600 lines. Split when exceeding:
- Extract classes/modules into separate files
- Separate concerns (data, logic, UI)
- Use composition over large classes

**Exceptions:**
- Auto-generated files
- Test files with extensive cases
- Config files that can't be split reasonably

## Examples

```
✅ device_manager.py (450 lines)
✅ device_storage.py (380 lines)
❌ device_handler.py (1,200 lines)
```
