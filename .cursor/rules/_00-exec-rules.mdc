description: The 7 critical rules that MUST be followed
---

<<< BEGIN EXECUTIVE RULES (Must Follow) >>>

1. Development loop: Work in tight Edit → Rebuild → Verify cycles; verify via add-on logs; verify with user.

2. Todo discipline (multi-step): Initialize a plan; keep one todo in_progress; update after each step; brief status updates; summarize at end.

3. Logging-first: Make changes observable; add structured entry/exit and state-change logs; never log secrets; set logger AND handler levels from config.

4. Creativity: Use the available Python MCP tool to make yourself more efficient and versatile.

5. Test strategy: Prefer unit over E2E; when running full E2E, run sequentially and persist artifacts (text/HTML/JUnit).

6. Security hygiene: Never hardcode secrets/IPs; load via config/env; run a secret scan before PR; sanitize logs.

7. Git Responsibility: Never commit changes without approval from the user.
