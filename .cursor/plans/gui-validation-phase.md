# Phase 8: GUI Validation & Human Interaction Testing

## Purpose
Validate end-user experience through Home Assistant GUI to ensure cloud relay mode doesn't break user-facing functionality and that real-time device control works correctly.

## Prerequisites
- Addon running in cloud relay mode (with forwarding enabled)
- At least one physical device powered on
- Home Assistant accessible at http://localhost:8123

## Test Categories

### 1. Device Control - Light Entities

**Test 1.1: Basic On/Off Control**
- [ ] Navigate to Home Assistant dashboard
- [ ] Locate a Cync light entity (e.g., "Hallway Floodlight 1")
- [ ] Click to turn OFF → Verify light physically turns off
- [ ] Click to turn ON → Verify light physically turns on
- [ ] Check entity state updates in real-time (no delay)
- [ ] Verify MQTT messages are sent (check logs)

**Test 1.2: Brightness Control**
- [ ] Select a tunable light entity
- [ ] Open light control panel
- [ ] Drag brightness slider from 0% to 100%
- [ ] Verify physical light brightness changes smoothly
- [ ] Set brightness to 50% → Verify physical brightness matches
- [ ] Check entity attribute shows correct brightness value

**Test 1.3: Color Temperature Control** (for tunable white bulbs)
- [ ] Open light control panel
- [ ] Move color temperature slider (2000K to 7000K range)
- [ ] Verify physical light color changes (warm to cool)
- [ ] Set to 2000K (warm) → Verify warm white light
- [ ] Set to 7000K (cool) → Verify cool white light

## Known Limitations (Not Testable)

- Visual appearance of physical lights (color accuracy)
- Exact physical brightness calibration
- RF signal strength variations
- Multi-user concurrent access (requires multiple browsers)

---

## Recommended Test Order

1. Start with basic on/off controls (Test 1.1, 2.1)
2. Test attribute controls (Test 1.2, 1.3)
3. Validate bidirectional updates (Test 3)
4. Check addon UI (Tests 5, 6)
5. Use developer tools (Test 7)
6. Stress test with edge cases (Tests 8, 9)
7. Final visual validation (Test 10)

## Automation Potential

**Cannot be automated:**
- Physical light observation
- Visual color validation
- Physical switch toggling

**Can be automated:**
- API/service calls
- Entity state verification
- Log parsing
- Configuration changes
- MQTT message validation

**Hybrid approach:**
- Send commands programmatically
- Human validates physical device response
- Automated verification of state updates

**Estimated Testing Time:** 45-60 minutes (human-in-the-loop)
