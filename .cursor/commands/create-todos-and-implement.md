# Create or update your todo list and continue with implementation

## TODOs

1. Review the findings and recommendations from recent markdownlint conventions and documentation review.
2. Create or update a todo list based on the issues and recommendations found.
3. Implement each todo item systematically, updating the documentation, examples, and configuration as needed.
4. After each step, mark the corresponding todo as complete and proceed to the next.
5. Run required linting and formatting commands after changes to ensure compliance.
6. Validate that all documentation and examples accurately demonstrate correct and incorrect usage as described.
7. Ensure all project-specific configuration and overrides are clearly documented.
8. Final verification: all todos addressed, code/examples linted, and checklist items completed.
9. Report any lower-priority items or new issues encountered during implementation that have not yet been addressed.

## Implementation

- Begin with the highest-priority or blocking items from the findings (e.g., critical documentation errors, missing configs).
- Generate or update the `/working-files/` directory with a timestamped subfolder for progress artifacts if required.
- Use concise, clearly-indicated commit messages for each completed todo in implementation.
- Prioritize clean, DRY implementation, following project standards and critical rules (see `_00-rules-prefix.mdc`).
- Communicate status updates after each significant step.
